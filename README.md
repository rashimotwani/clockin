ClockIn

One of the biggest challenges that the covid pandemic introduced in our lives was a chain of never-ending meets and links making it extremely tedious to keep track of the events. This is where our website ClockIn has come to the rescue. Using ClockIn the users can add events to their calendar, edit them, get reminders through emails all combined with different view modes. Keeping track of meets from various ids can be tedious so ClockIn has the feature to include events from the user's google calendar making scheduling very convenient for the user. This site is created by first-year students of IIT Indore Divnoor, Harsh, Rashi, and Vanshika as part of IITISoc 2021. You can give us feedback for our site by contacting us or even better by contributing to our repository!
